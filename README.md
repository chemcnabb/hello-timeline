[Pebble timeline API][timeline-guides] with user tokens.

## Getting Started

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/pebble-examples/hello-timeline.git
```

Generate a new UUID for your copy of this project, and copy it into
`appinfo.json`.

```
uuidgen
```

Enable the timeline for the watchapp by uploading it to the 
[dev-portal](https://dev-portal.getpebble.com/) and clicking 'Enable timeline'. 
This enables the timeline API to identify the app.

Build the Pebble app and run it on the Basalt emulator.

```
cd hello-timeline/pebble/
pebble build
pebble install --emulator basalt
```

Launch the Node.js backend application.

```
cd hello-timeline/node/ 
npm install
node app.js
```

Launch the app on the emulator. You should see a message telling you that a Pin
has been sent to your timeline. Exit the app and press down to view the
timeline. You should see your pin! (You may have to wait a minute or two and
then exit and reload the timeline to see the pin.)
